*Specializing in ages 5-10*

### Trailhead

Are you unsure which path to take or where the dang trailhead even is? Are you thinking of making some radical changes in your child's education, or even just some minor tweaks to help uplift your family? There are many paths to take and the secret is, you don't have to follow the one that someone else is on. Let me work with you to build a path that inspires joy, connection, and self-direction. 

### Curriculum Development

Has your child expressed interest in a topic, but you just don’t know where to go with it? Not sure how to teach reading... or maybe even scarier, math? I will work with you to develop a fully-fleshed out unit including:

* * Scope and sequence for the unit
  * Step-by-step lesson plans for you to use at home
  * Resource guide

All units are developed collaboratively and with your child’s specific skills and interests in mind. We can remain in contact while you move through the unit so lessons can be reworked and updated as you go along.

### Evaluation

Are you feeling stuck or not sure what to do next with your child? Are you concerned about your child’s progress or wondering if they have a learning disability? Let’s meet about your concerns and discuss next-step options for your child. 

After an initial conversation with you, I will meet with your child to engage in some fun activities, perform basic skills testing, and collect observations regarding your concerns. We will then have a follow-up meeting to discuss my findings and provide you with recommendations for next-steps.

### Homeschool Classroom Design

Just getting into homeschooling or have a homeschool setup that isn’t working? Are you overwhelmed by the mountains of materials that are building up? I will come to your home and design a homeschool learning space that promotes learning, independence, and excitement.

### Field Trips

Guided field trips to a variety of locations with pre and post lessons to build understanding and reinforce learning.

### In-home Classes and Tutoring

Weekly lessons to target a specific academic need or enrich your child's learning experience. For one child or a small group of children.

### Something Else or a Combination of Offerings?

Just like your child, it's hard to pin-point exactly what you're looking for. I'd love to hear what you're thinking and work with you to design a plan that works for your family.
