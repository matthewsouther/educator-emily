# Coaching Services

### New Client Consultation

Schedule a **free 20 min. phone or video consultation** so we can talk through what you've been doing at home, what you're looking for, and what I can offer. I will answer any questions you have about homeschool coaching and we can figure out next steps together. 

### Coaching Sessions

Coaching sessions are designed to help you through the challenges of homeschooling. We will discuss what's been working and not working in your homeschool along with academic and social goals you have for your child. Then I will coach you through building a home learning environment that inspires joy, connection, and self-direction. **After all coaching sessions I will send you notes from our discussion, a "next-steps" plan, and resources to use.** 

Potential packages include:

* * **Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly 30 min. calls** to touch-base and troubleshoot if needed.   
  * **1-hour phone or video call** to discuss how things are going and what adjustments could be made. 
  * **Three 1-hour coaching sessions.** Ideal for new homeschool families, and those looking to dig deeper into their plan with some intensive review.  

### Curriculum Development

Has your child expressed interest in a topic, but you just don’t know where to go with it? Not sure how to teach reading... or maybe even scarier, math? I will work with you to develop a fully-fleshed out unit including:

* * Scope and sequence for the unit
  * Step-by-step lesson plans for you to use at home
  * Resource guide

All units are developed collaboratively and with your child’s specific skills and interests in mind. We can remain in contact while you move through the unit so lessons can be reworked and updated as you go along.

### Evaluation

Are you feeling stuck or not sure what to do next with your child? Are you concerned about your child’s progress or wondering if they have a learning disability? Let’s meet about your concerns and discuss next-step options for your child. 

After an initial conversation with you, I will meet with your child to engage in some fun activities, perform basic skills testing, and collect observations regarding your concerns. We will then have a follow-up meeting to discuss my findings. *While I cannot diagnose learning or behavioral differences, I can provide you with recommendations for next-steps based on my experiences working with hundreds of children over many years.* 

### Homeschool Classroom Design

Just getting into homeschooling or have a homeschool setup that isn’t working? Are you overwhelmed by the mountains of materials that are building up? I will come to your home and design a homeschool learning space that promotes learning, independence, and excitement.

Sessions meet in one of the children’s homes and requires one parent helper per session.

She always pushes herself, classmates and her students to go a little deeper and as a result her students were more motivated and positively inspired by her dedication."*

> *"I just wanted to take this opportunity to say how grateful I am for you being my daughter's teacher this school year. She is typically shy, reserved, and almost always takes a while for her to adjust to people. However, I am very pleased that she was able to adjust quickly having you. I have seen how great you are with the children, how well you interact with them, how engaging you are and how well the children's behavior changed week after week and now my daughter is more sociable, participates in class, and overall more attentive."*
