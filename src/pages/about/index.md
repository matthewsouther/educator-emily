I am a person with many passions and a deep enthusiasm for life and learning. I explore the world through music, art, literature, science, and the outdoors, but my deepest passion--and truly my life’s work--is working with children.

I have been an educator in public and private schools since 2008. I began my teaching experience in a highly progressive school in Menlo Park, California. This was a place where children and the valuable work they do--play--was deeply respected. Here I learned the importance of giving children trust to know the abilities of their bodies, to take physical, social, and intellectual risks, and to ask for help when they need it. As an educator, I believe I am tasked with being a guide and mentor to the children I work with. I teach my students reading and math, but I also encourage leadership in the children, hold group meetings to resolve social conflicts, and listen carefully to understand each child’s interests and motivations in the world.

Since then I have continued to grow as an educator and have honed my “learn-by-doing” philosophy through teaching work at a variety of school types--public, private, and a homeschool resource center. 

At the heart of my teaching philosophy is the belief that to build self-confident, happy, and excited-to-learn children, we must first meet each child where they are and allow them to explore their own ideas about how to approach a problem or learn a new concept. Children are born excited to learn and it is our most vital role as adults and educators to nurture that.

I live in Portland, Oregon with my husband and two sons. You'll often find us exploring nature, being silly, having dance parties, and reveling in the joy of learning.
