  title: Why Educator Emily?
  description: Guess what? Education is not about any specific academic content.
    It's about teaching your child how to learn. Your child learned to crawl,
    walk, talk, and love all through self-direction, internal motivation, and
    space to explore. Now you can fuel that drive so they can follow their path
    to becoming creative, problem-solving, secure, and happy grown-ups. Isn't
    that what we all want for our children?
description: "I am your support system. I am your secret insider who knows what
  happens in education. I am passionate about learning and even more passionate
  about setting children free to soar.  "

        I believe in education through connection. We all think and learn
        differently and your family is it's own unique organism. That's why I
        offer you a place to build your vision for your family and your child's
        education. There are as many options as there are humans and I can help
        you navigate the winding path and form a trailhead that is right for
        your family.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
