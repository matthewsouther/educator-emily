  title: Let me help your child take off
  description: Your child was born a scientist, explorer, and problem solver.  She
    learned to crawl, walk, and talk all through self-direction, internal
    motivation, and space to experiment. Now you can fuel that drive so she can
    follow her path to becoming a creative, problem-solving, secure, and happy
    grown-up. Isn't that what we all want for our children?
heading: You can do this. I can help.
description: "I am on your team. I am your secret weapon who knows the ins and
  outs of education. I am passionate about learning and even more passionate
  about setting children free to soar.  "

    description: "Coaching sessions are designed to help you through the challenges
      of homeschooling. Wherever you are on your homeschooling journey, I will
      listen to what's been working and not working and any fears and ambitions
      you have. Then I will coach you through creating a learning environment
      that fosters self-direction, a love of learning, and family connection. "

          I believe in education through connection. We all think and learn
          differently and your family is its own unique organism. That's why I
          offer you a place to build your vision for your family and your
          child's education. There are as many options as there are humans and I
          can help you navigate the winding path and form a plan that is right
          for your family.

          overwhelming, and a drain on your time. I can help. Let's chat about
          what your child is interested in and I can create a unit designed for
          your family. Open and go lessons, field trips, and resources. Done. "

        text: "I will develop weekly classes on a variety of topics for your child or a
          small group of children. My teaching is rich in hands-on learning, and
          I believe deeply in the \"learn by doing\" teaching philosophy. To
          give you a few examples, I have taught countless science classes,
          process art, book clubs, mindfulness, early literacy, poetry, math,
          and team-building/STEM challenges. The sky is the limit here and I
          look forward to developing a class specific to your child's interests
          and needs. "
