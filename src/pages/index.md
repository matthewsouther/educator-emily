  title: Why Emily?
  description: Your child was born a scientist, explorer, and problem solver.  She
    learned to crawl, walk, talk, and love all through self-direction, internal
    motivation, and space to explore. Now you can fuel that drive so they can
    follow their path to becoming creative, problem-solving, secure, and happy
    grown-ups. Isn't that what we all want for our children?
description: "I am on your team. I am your secret weapon who knows what happens
  in education. I am passionate about learning and even more passionate about
  setting children free to soar.  "

        I believe in education through connection. We all think and learn
        differently and your family is its own unique organism. That's why I
        offer you a place to build your vision for your family and your child's
        education. There are as many options as there are humans and I can help
        you navigate the winding path and form a trailhead that is right for
        your family.

        overwhelming, and a drain on your time. I can help. Let's chat about
        what your child is interested in and I can create a unit designed for
        your family. Open and go lessons, field trips, and resources. Done. "

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
