  title: Let me help your child take off
  description: Your child was born a scientist, explorer, and problem solver.  She
    learned to crawl, walk, and talk all through self-direction, internal
    motivation, and space to experiment. Now you can fuel that drive so she can
    follow her path to becoming a creative, problem-solving, secure, and happy
    grown-up. Isn't that what we all want for our children?
description: "I am on your team. I am your secret weapon who knows the ins and
  outs of education. I am passionate about learning and even more passionate
  about setting children free to soar.  "

          I believe in education through connection. We all think and learn
          differently and your family is its own unique organism. That's why I
          offer you a place to build your vision for your family and your child's
          education. There are as many options as there are humans and I can help
          you navigate the winding path and form a plan that is right for your
          family.

          your family. Open and go lessons, field trips, and resources. Done. "
