  title: Why Educator Emily?
  description: Guess what? Education is not about any specific academic content.
    It's about teaching your child how to learn. Your child learned to crawl,
    walk, talk, and love all through self-direction, internal motivation, and
    space to explore. Now you can fuel that drive so they can follow their path
    to becoming creative, problem-solving, secure, and happy grown-ups. Isn't
    that what we all want for our children?
description: "I am your support system. I am your secret insider who knows what
  happens in education. I am passionate about learning and even more passionate
  about setting children free to soar.  "

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
